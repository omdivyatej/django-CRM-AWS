1. "Template does not exist"
 return render(request,"studentapp/student_home.html",{'students':a})
Make sure there is "stu.... ", not 'stu....'
2. When using forms, error of NoReverseMismatch
you need to defind name in urls as well, mandatory.
For, 
<form method="POST" action="{% url 'add_student' %}">

path('add_student',views.add_student) : this will not work
<form method="POST" action="{% url 'add_student' %}"> this will work, hence name is required.

if you use name, it is better any day. URL could be somethinglike student.add_student
Now, if you change the url someday, it will still get access. 
Now, if you had used student/add_student hrdcoded value for link, you would have to change every link in the future.

3. For forms, you have to make forms.py with the Meta class to model the html form. BUt in input type in HTML code, ensure name="..  "  is equal to the forms.py lable columns.

Eg.
<input type="text" name="Name">
    <input type="number" name="Marks">
    <input type="submit"></button>

class AddStudentForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model= StudentMembers
        fields= ['name','marks']


This wont work because field names are 'name','marks', wherease html names are "Name", "MArks" . Capital N,M instead of n,m

<input type="text" name="name">
    <input type="number" name="marks">
    <input type="submit"></button>

class AddStudentForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model= StudentMembers
        fields= ['name','marks']

This will work

3. LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL ="/home"
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL= "/login"  
Needs to be there is setting.py file mandatory
